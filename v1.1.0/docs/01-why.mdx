# Why?

Edtr.io was born from the needs of the learning platform [serlo.org](https://serlo.org/)
and with all the experience we gathered from creating educational resources by a diverse group of authors.

We tried out a lot of other editing libraries before we settled on creating our own.
Existing rich text libraries (e.g. [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/), [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/))
came closest to what we needed: a way to build intuitive WYSIWYG rich text editors.

After using them for a while, we noticed that the rich text part is only a small (albeit very important) foundation of what we needed, though.
When creating interactive learning resources, we often need much more than that. Think for example
about multiple choice exercises and more interactive learning games. Providing an editing experience
for such use cases often requires us to have a tight control over the user experience. Trying to achieve that with something like Slate was hard, though:

- Since Slate plugins are build around rich text editing, you often have to deal with rather low-level
  details like text selection.
- For Slate to do its magic, you also have to adhere to a couple of assumptions. Depending on what
  you want to render, you might break something of Slate's behavior (e.g. your plugin losing focus).

These reasons lead us to build an abstraction layer on top of that: A composable plugin system representing
a tree of content elements where rich text is only contained in the leaf nodes.
