# Why?

Edtr.io was born from the needs of the learning platform
[serlo.org](https://serlo.org/) and with all the experience we gathered from
creating educational resources by a diverse group of authors.

We tried out a lot of other editing libraries before we settled on creating our
own (like [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/) or
[Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/)). However we noticed that the rich text part is
only a small (albeit very important) foundation of what we need.

When creating interactive learning resources, we need a better abstraction
for developing editing experiences that are not primarily dealing with rich text.
It's similar to comparing Assembly with a high-level programming language: With
Edtr.io you will have increased productivity since you do not have to deal with
low-level details in most cases.

Take for example multiple choice exercises and interactive learning games:
Providing a great editing experience for such use cases often requires us to have a tight
control over the user experience. Trying to achieve that with a rich text
library like Slate is hard, because:

- Since Slate plugins are build around rich text editing, you often have to deal
  with rather low-level details like text selection.
- For Slate to do its magic, you also have to adhere to a couple of assumptions.
  Depending on what you want to render, you might break something (e.g. your
  plugin loses its focus).

These reasons lead us to build Edtr.io as an abstraction layer on top of
that: A composable plugin system representing a tree of content elements where
rich text is only contained in the leaf nodes.
